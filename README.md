## Overview
This project utilizes Tableau to dive into the trends of Citi Bikes in the New York area. Understanding how bike rentals work in NYC can help provide useful information how to launch bikes in another city, such as Des Moines, Iowa.

Important metrics that are included in the challenge exercise include: 
1. Checkout times for users
2. Checkout times by gender
3. Trips by weekday per hour
4. Trips by gender (trips by weekday per hour)
5. User trips by gender by weekday
6. Top starting location
7. Top ending location 

## Results

Results for each metric listed above include:

1. Checkout times for users
  * Checkout times (meaning trip duration) ranged from less than an hour to 23 hours. We saw peak trip duration at about 5 hours. 

2. Checkout times by gender
  * Males had the highest proportion of rented bikes. We saw significantly less bike usage between females and unknown. 

3. Trips by weekday per hour
  * Trends differed based on whether it was a weekday or weekend
  * Weekday trends show heaver usage between the hours of 6am to 9am Monday-Friday. Similarly, heavier usage in the evenings on Monday-Friday from 5pm-7pm. This    could imply that bikes are used for commuting to work on weekdays. 
  * Weekends displayed heavier usage between the hours of 10am-7pm on Saturdays & Sunday. Bikes are probably used more for recreation on the weekends. 

4. Trips by gender (trips by weekday per hour)
  * Both Female and Male trends look similar to the previous graph that is not broken down by gender
  * Unknown gender shows no clear trend of bike use, and bike use is lower than males & females
  * Similarly to the "Checkout times by gender" graph, males display the highest use of citi bikes

5. User trips by gender by weekday
  * Both females & males who are subscribers account for more bikes that are rented than customers 

6. Top starting location
  * Trip starting locations are heaviest in lower - mid Manhattan 

7. Top ending location 
  * Trip ending locations are heaviest in lower - mid Manhattan 

## Summary
From diving into the rental and usage trends around Citi Bikes in NYC, here are some of my conclusions:

* Citi bikes are most popular among males
* Bikes are being used for both recreation and communiting to work
* Lower- mid Manhattan has a combination of plenty of tourist attactions, and where most people in the area commute to work. Bike placement can be the most utilized in denser areas of the city that provide both commutor & recreation options
